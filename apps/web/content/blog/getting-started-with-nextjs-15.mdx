# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several new features that make building web applications even easier and more performant. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started with the latest version of Next.js.

## What's New in Next.js 15

### App Router

The App Router is now the recommended way to build Next.js applications. It uses React Server Components by default, which allows you to write components that render exclusively on the server.

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, Next.js 15!</h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-muted">Welcome to the future of web development.</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

### Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to define asynchronous server functions that can be called directly from your components. This eliminates the need to create API routes for data mutations.

```typescript
// app/actions.ts
'use server'

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')
  
  // Save to database
  await db.post.create({
    data: { title, content }
  })
  
  // Revalidate the posts page
  revalidatePath('/posts')
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other options.

## Key Concepts

### Server Components

Server Components are React components that render exclusively on the server. They can directly access backend resources and don't add JavaScript to the client bundle.

### Client Components

Client Components are interactive components that require client-side JavaScript. Use the `'use client'` directive at the top of your file.

### Data Fetching

Next.js 15 provides built-in data fetching capabilities with async/await in Server Components:

```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <main>{data.title}</main>
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. With its improved performance, simplified data fetching, and enhanced developer experience, it's the best choice for your next project.
